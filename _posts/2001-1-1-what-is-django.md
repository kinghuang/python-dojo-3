Django is a very popular Python web-framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

As compared to Flask (from the last dojo) it:

	- is pre-structured
	- has more "magic" (not necessarily a good thing)
	- has a steeper learning curve
	- offers more "out-of-the-box" (not necessarily a good thing either)
