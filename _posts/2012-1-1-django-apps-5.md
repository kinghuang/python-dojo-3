Now that we've covered a Django app's model, template and view components, I must tell you that this is the Django take on MVC. **They call it MTV.**

Now try Googling "Django MTV" and see how much Hollywood crap you have to sort through to get at the real stuff!

There is a spiel about this on the [Django FAQ page](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/general/#django-appears-to-be-a-mvc-framework-but-you-call-the-controller-the-view-and-the-view-the-template-how-come-you-don-t-use-the-standard-names) if you're interested.
